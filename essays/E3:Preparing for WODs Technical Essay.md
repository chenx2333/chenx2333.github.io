My most recent Work of the Day (WOD) involved Invoice1, which required me to use expressions and variables in JavaScript to display an invoice table using document.write(). This WOD posed more challenges for me compared to previous ones because a lot of stuffs are new to me. Consequently, I spent a significant amount of time reviewing the reading materials and screencasts to fully grasp the instructions. Additionally, I encountered difficulty in creating the table, as I did not fully copied the code in, leading me to consult the screencast for guidance.

For my initial attempt at the WOD, I opted not to watch the screencast. This approach proved beneficial as it allows me to delve deeper into understanding the concepts at hand. I realized that it's really important to prepared through reading the assigned materials and watching the relevant screencasts beforehand, ensuring that I had a solid foundation to refer back to in case of confusion. Although, I had a deeper understanding with the first attempt but it's really struggle.

To enhance my preparedness for future WODs, I plan to have all the required readings and screencast open in separate tabs. This way, I can easily locate the appropriate references while navigating through the instructions. In the next WOD, I intend to read through all the instructions first and gather all necessary references concurrently, thereby streamlining the process and optimizing my approach to tackling the task.
