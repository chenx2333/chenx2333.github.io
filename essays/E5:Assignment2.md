My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:

I have become proficient in using JavaScript to create dynamic web applications, as demonstrated in my ability to fetch data from a server and dynamically update the DOM based on user input.
At the same time,my understanding of server-side programming has improved, as evidenced by my ability to set up an Express server to handle HTTP requests and responses. Lastly, I have learned to effectively debug and troubleshoot code, which has significantly improved my problem-solving skills.

I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:

I need to enhance my knowledge of data structures and algorithms to optimize the performance of my code. 
For example, I know what the IR requirements are and what it's asking for, but it's very hard to start my first step and plan out my further steps because I don't have the experience and I'm uncertain if I did it right.

I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:

I have learned a lot from doing WODs, but I don't think I can do them without copying the screencast because I still need more practice on my coding skills, also I felt myself not understood some of the coding concepts completely. When doing Smartphone products 3, I think I was having a very hard time which I had faced many problems.

The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:

The labs have help me learn, but I'm not able to complete them with confidence because a lot of times I felt myself not understanding what it is asking me to do. I understand that it's meaningful for students to think further and explore but I will say some parts are very difficult to solve it out without instructors or clear instructions.

I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:

I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment1 but I don't feel ready to work on Assignment 2, this is because my Assignment 1 faced some issues when I tried to start my Assignment 2. Overall, it's not a good sign to start off, I think I will be facing plenty problems doing Assignment 2.

I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:

I think the class can be improved with more additional resources or tutorials for topics that students find challenging, such as deploying our projects to cloud. Also, maybe more office hours to help students with the assignments.

What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):

What helps me the most in class are WODs, one on one help, difficult assignments but with plenty help. These things helped me the most becuase I'm more a hands on person rather than reading off materials.
