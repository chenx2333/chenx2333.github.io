I have chosen to pursue a double major in Management Information Systems (MIS) and Accounting because I believe it offers a powerful blend of financial acumen and technological expertise.
I believe that studying MIS will provide me with the knowledge to leverage technology for application in business systems, leading to more efficient processes and informed decision-making. This skill set will be highly beneficial for my future career path.
This dual major not only enhances my competitiveness in today's job market but also positions me as a candidate capable of navigating the dynamic intersection of accounting and technology.
