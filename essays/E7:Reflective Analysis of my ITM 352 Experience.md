Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
For this assignment, we were tasked with developing our e-commerce project with user registration, login functionality, persistence of user data, security measures, and personalization features. The detailed requirements and specifications can be found on this page:(https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2.html).

What did you learn from this assignment?
From this assignment, I learned how to implement user authentication and registration systems in a web application using JavaScript. I gained knowledge about password encryption, user session management, and data persistence techniques. Additionally, I learned about the importance of security measures in web development and how to ensure user privacy and data integrity.

Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
No, I worked on this assignment individually.

How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
I primarily relied on online resources such as documentation, tutorials, and Chatgpt to seek help when needed. Additionally, I utilized the course materials and lecture notes provided by the instructor. I needed help understanding certain concepts related to passing query strings, which I found clarification on through course materials.

How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
Developing this assignment was different from assignment #1 as it required the implementation of user authentication and registration functionality, which involved more complex logic and interactions. Additionally, ensuring security measures such as password encryption added another layer of complexity to the development process compared to assignment #1.

Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
(a) Thinking about how to do something: 40%
(b) Writing code: 20%
(c) Testing and debugging: 40%

Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
What worked well with this project was the clear specification of requirements, which provided a clear direction for development. However, one aspect that did not work well was understanding and implementing complex concepts.

If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
If I could go back in time, I would allocate more time for the initial setup and configuration of the development environment to avoid unnecessary problems later on. Additionally, I would plan the implementation of user authentication and registration more thoroughly to ensure a smoother development process.
