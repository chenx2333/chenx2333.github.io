Starting BrowserHistory1 was quite challenging for me. I initially felt lost and unsure of where to begin, prompting me to resort to watching the screencast solution. To grasp the code, I paused and played the video repeatedly, meticulously copying each line. Despite investing around an hour and a half, the result was a functioning solution that I didn't truly comprehend. Without the crutch of the screencast, I doubted my ability to replicate it independently, especially within the allotted time frame.

This approach proved frustrating as progress was slow, and I committed numerous errors due to a lack of understanding regarding the code's purpose. Realizing the limitations of this method, I decided to delete the screencast-derived version of BrowserHistory1. Armed with a timer, I embarked on the task independently. Whenever I encountered hurdles, I turned to the screencast to identify analogous challenges, subsequently rewatching the segment until I comprehended the problem and devised a solution. I would then pause the video, return to the task (timer still ticking), and resume my progress.

Although I exceeded the recommended time, the effort eventually paid off, and I completed the WOD in approximately 45 minutes. Despite the success, I chose to discard this version, restart the timer, and tackle the challenge again. This time around, I only consulted the screencast once, completing the task in a quicker 37 minutes. Empowered by this achievement, I repeated the process, finishing the WOD in a remarkable 17 minutes. The confidence gained from successfully navigating without reliance on the screencast bolstered my belief in improved skills, making me eager to face the next challenge, BrowserHistory2, without resorting to code copying.

Reflecting on this experience, I would advise against the inclination to watch the screencast and copy code verbatim. Instead, I propose attempting the WOD first, even anticipating a potential DNF. If obstacles arise, take a moment to contemplate the issue before turning to the screencast for guidance, or consider external resources such as Google searches, lab materials, or readings. Completing the WOD, even if it exceeds the recommended time, serves as a valuable measure of progress. Subsequent attempts, each initiated with a reset timer, provide opportunities for improvement. Deleting the initial project is crucial to resist the temptation of code duplication during subsequent WOD iterations.
